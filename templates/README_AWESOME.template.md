# Awesome Claude Code

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A once semi-credible list of slash-commands, CLAUDE.md files, CLI tools, and other resources for enhancing your [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) workflow, which is apparently now the official training grounds for low-effort spam bots.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're a human doing something cool with Claude Code, you might consider waiting a little until these pests go away before you submit a recommendation. Alternatively, if you're using Claude Code to spin up template repos, _share the source repo, not the rubbish it produces_ - that might actually be interesting and worth sharing.
